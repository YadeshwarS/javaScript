        <b>Start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($):</b> Variable names must 
        begin with a letter (A-Z, a-z), an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). 
         They cannot start with a number. <br> <br>

        <b>Consist of letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs:</b> After the first 
        character, variable names can include letters, numbers (0-9), underscores (_), 
        or dollar signs ($). Spaces and special characters (like @, #, etc.) are not 
        allowed. <br> <br>

        <b>Case sensitivity:</b>JavaScript is case-sensitive, so myVariable and MyVariable 
        would be treated as different variables. <br> <br>

        <b>Avoid using reserved words:</b>There are certain reserved words in JavaScript that
         have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names. 
         Examples of reserved words include if, else, while, for, and function. <br> <br>

        <b>Use camelCase or snake_case:</b>It's common to use either camelCase or 
         snake_case to name variables. In camelCase, the first word starts with a 
         lowercase letter, and subsequent words start with uppercase letters, 
         like myVariableName. In snake_case, all words are in lowercase, and words 
         are separated by underscores, like my_variable_name. <br> <br>

    <h2>
        Here are some examples of valid variable names:
    </h2>
    <b>
        let age = 30; <br>
        let userName = "John"; <br>
        let _counter = 0; <br>
        let $totalAmount = 100; <br>
        let myLongVariableName = "Hello"; <br>
    </b>

    <h2>
        And here are some examples of invalid variable names:
    </h2>
    <b>
        // Invalid: Starts with a number <br>
        let 2times = 5; <br>

        // Invalid: Contains a special character <br>
        let first@name = "Alice"; <br>
 
        // Invalid: Reserved word <br>
        let function = "something"; <br>
   </b>
