        /*declaring a variable in JavaScript means giving it a name so you can store and
         work with data. To declare a variable, you use keywords like var, let, or const, 
         followed by the variable name:

var: In older versions of JavaScript, you use var to declare a variable.
 It looks like this:
*/
var age = 30;
document.write(age);
//The variable age now holds the value 30.

/*

let: In modern JavaScript, you use let to declare a variable that can change its value:
*/
let score = 100;
document.write(score);
//The variable score holds the value 100, and you can change it later in your code.

/*
const: When you use const, you declare a variable that cannot change its value. 
It remains constant:
*/
const pi = 3.14159;
document.write(pi);
//The variable pi holds the value 3.14159, and you cannot assign a new value to it.

/*
When you declare a variable, you give it a name that you can use to refer to the 
data it holds. For example, age, score, and pi are the names of variables in the examples
 above.

Variables are like containers that help you store and manipulate information in your 
JavaScript programs. You can use them to store numbers, text, dates, and other types 
of data, making your code more flexible and powerful.
